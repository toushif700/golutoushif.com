                                 <hr>  <b> The Avengers</b>  are a fictional team of superheroes that appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (cover-dated Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby. Labeled "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", the Avengers originally consisted of Iron Man, Ant-Man, Hulk, Thor and the Wasp. The original Captain America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, and joined the group after they revived him.

                                    The Avengers are an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from the Marvel Comics portfolio. Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. This in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X-Men, whose characters were created specifically to be part of their team, with the team being central to their identity. The Avengers were created to create a new line of books to sell and to cross-promote Marvel Comics characters. An Iron Man fan might buy an Avengers book because Iron Man appears in them, and perhaps in turn take an interest in Thor, who appears in the same book as Iron Man's friend and comrade.[2] The cast usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own solo books, such as Iron Man, alongside a number of lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure, such as 
                                    The Avengers have appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books, including several different animated television series and direct-to-video films. Beginning in 2008, they were adapted to theatrical movies in a series of movies from Marvel Studios known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, culminating with The Avengers in 2012, with

After he abused his wife, failed to win back the confidence of the Avengers with a ruse and was duped by the villain Egghead, Pym was jailed.[86] Pym would later outwit Egghead and defeated the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly, and proved his innocence.[87] Pym reconciled with the Wasp, but they decided to remain apart.[88] Pym retired from super-heroics,[88] but returned years later.[89]

                                     This was followed by several major storylines, such as "Ultimate Vision" in which the Vision took over the world's computer systems in a misguided attempt to create world peace;[90][91][92][93] the formation of the West Coast Avengers;[94][95] and "Avengers Under Siege" which involved the second Baron Zemo and the Masters of Evil taking over the mansion and severely injuring Jarvis and Hercules.[96] "Assault on Olympus" featured Hercules' father, Zeus, blaming the Avengers for his son's injuries and brought them to Olympus for trial,[97] and the "Heavy Metal" arc saw the Super Adaptoid organized several robotic villains for an assault on the team.[98] New members during the 1980s included Tigra;[99] the She-Hulk;[100] Monica Rambeau (then going by the name Captain Marvel);[101] Starfox (the brother of Thanos);[102] Hawkeye's wife, Mockingbird;[94] and Namor,[103] while Henry Pym emerged from retirement to join the West Coast Avengers.[89] Spider-Man was again offered membership,[104] but failed to gain admission due to security concerns by the Avengers' government liaison.[105]

                                                        <b> Life of Pi</b>  is a 2012 adventure drama film[11] based on Yann Martel's 2001 novel of the same name. Directed by Ang Lee, and written by David Magee, the film stars Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Rafe Spall, Tabu, Adil Hussain, and Gérard Depardieu. The storyline revolves around an Indian teenager named "Pi" Patel, telling a novelist about his life story, and how at 16 he survives a shipwreck and is adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. The film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuarón and Jean-Pierre Jeunet involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was split between India, Taiwan and Montreal in 2011, with Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H) handling the visual effects work. The film had its worldwide premiere as the opening film of the 50th New York Film

                                                                Pi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after the swimming pool in France. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the name "Pi" (the Greek letter, π) to avoid the sound-alike nickname "Pissing Patel". He is raised in a Hindu family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he "just wants to love God". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi's family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.

                                                            When Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench, drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.

                                                                    After the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a resourceful orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.

                                                                    Pi fashions a small tethered raft from flotation vests to which he retreats for safety from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger as well. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then comes threateningly towards Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a humpback whale comes too close to the boat, destroying the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is also helping keep himself alive.

                                                                    Weeks later they encounter a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic, digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.

                                                                    Pi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching the coast of Mexico. Pi is saddened that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. He is rescued and brought to a hospital. Insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by human survivors: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutis <hr>

Farhan's airplane takes off but he fakes a heart attack and creates an emergency landing and escapes from the airport to the house of his other best friend and collegemate Raju Rastogi. The two then rush to the campus of their old college named Imperial College of Engineering and meet Chatur, who reminds them of the bet which they and Rancho had made ten years ago about who will end up more successful in the next ten years, as he boasts to them about his more successful career in the United States of America as the vice-president of Rockledge Corporation, an American conglomerate. Farhan and Raju initially berate him for his act, but calm down once he reveals to them that he has traced Rancho to Shimla. As the three leave for Shimla, Farhan reminisces about their college days.

                                                                                 Over a flashback, it is shown that Farhan has come to stay at the Imperial College of Engineering as his father forced him to pursue engineering. He then befriends his second roommate Raju who, has come from a poor family which has pinned very high hopes on him to get out of poverty. While being ragged by the seniors, they stumble upon the seemingly naive Rancho, who comes from a rich family but has a passion for engineering. Rancho, Raju and Farhan, now good friends, meet their college director Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe a.k.a. Virus, whose doctrinal methods of learning contrast with Rancho's carefree love for knowledge, resulting in a tiff between them on their first meeting. One day, when Joy Lobo, a student with a passion for engineering similar to Rancho's, is denied graduation by Virus on grounds of failure to submit his project, he dumps his innovative drone camera, which is picked up by Rancho. After the trio learns of Joy's predicament, Rancho recreates the drone camera. Unfortunately, before he can see his drone camera coming to life, Joy committed suicide. Later, when Rancho insults and embarrasses Virus in front of the other students, holding his approach responsible for Joy's death, he complains to Raju and Farhan's parents via letters. The trio is then confronted by Farhan and Raju's respective parents at their respective houses. Later, the hungry trio gatecrashes a wedding for dinner, whence Rancho bumps into a woman named Pia, advising her to leave her materially obsessive fiancé Suhas, which ends up in a comical demonstration pushing Pia to anger. However, in a twist, she turns out to be Virus' daughter, and Virus confronts the trio after Pia tricks Rancho; it turns out that the wedding is for Pia's elder sister Mona. The following morning, Virus summons Farhan and Raju and tells them to move in with Chatur, but Farhan decides to stay back, while Raju reluctantly decides to go on despite his friends' warning. Seeking to trap Chatur in order to teach Raju a lesson, Rancho and Farhan print Chatur's Teachers' Day speech edited with obscene words when the librarian, Dubey, is distracted by the duo. Following the speech debacle, which still fails to convince Raju, Chatur learns about the prank, only to angrily confront Rancho in a drunken state, when he makes a bet with Rancho about who would be more successful ten years later. After a few days, Rancho manipulates Pia into insulting and briefly dumping Suhas, which angers her. However, he learns that Raju's paralyzed father has suffered a stroke, and a reluctant Pia gives in to his plea for help. Rancho quickly admits him in a hospital by riding him into the hospital premises on Pia's scooter. Raju, who is able to catch up, realises his mistake on hearing that timely intervention saved his father from near death, and reunites with Rancho and Farhan. Pia also understands Rancho's character and falls in love with him. The trio writes exams, but Farhan and Raju are placed last, while discovering, in a shocker, that Rancho has topped, after they see Chatur venting frustration over his second rank.
                                                                                 
                                                                                 Back to the present, Farhan, Raju and Chatur reach Shimla and go to the house where Rancho lives. Over there, they are shocked to meet another young man, who identifies himself as the real Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. Farhan and Raju question Chatur about the Shimla address who reveals to them that he spotted Rancho in a photo taken by his secretary Tracy when she had come to Shimla to meet international scientist Phunsukh Wangdu, a sensational inventor with 400 patents to credit, who he has been trying to sign a deal with ahead of the Japanese rivals. Farhan and Raju then confront and threaten the "imposter" who, in confessing that he is the real Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad, inadvertently reveals to them that the acquaintance they knew was actually one Chhote, the son of the Chanchad family's gardener, who had an immense passion for learning and studying, and was taken in by the family after being orphaned. Ranchhoddas reveals that he would take advantage of Chhote's thirst for knowledge by having him appear as a proxy for his examinations and also have his assignments written by him. Shamaldas instructed Ranchhoddas's school headmaster, who caught the bluff one day, to continue the ruse so that Ranchhoddas would have a degree to his name. Ranchhoddas went to London for four years, while Chhote assumed his identity. Revealing that Shamaldas had struck a deal with Chhote to get him to attend college in return for him severing ties with his batchmates immediately after graduation, he tells them that Chhote misses them a lot. Farhan and Raju, promising to keep the 'Chhote' story a secret, leave with Chatur for Ladakh, where Chhote is apparently working in a school; Chatur is distressingly delighted to discover that "Rancho" is a teacher.

After Farhan and Raju drunkenly break into Virus's house and pee while Rancho sneaks in to propose to Pia, Virus threatens Raju with rustication the next morning unless he agrees to implicate Rancho in the scandal. Unwilling to either betray his best friend or disappoint his family yet again, a distraught Raju jumps off the window to attempt suicide, and ends up in a coma. The group successfully recovers him over the next two months, after which he attends his placement interview with a newfound confidence and secures a job while Farhan also successfully convinces his father about his passion for wildlife photography and contentment with the job he got with his role model, photographer Andre Istvan, in Hungary. Unable to take the insult any longer, Virus rigs the final examination question paper in order to fail Raju, but Pia obtains duplicate keys to her father's office and helps Rancho and Farhan break into the office to steal the question paper <hr>
